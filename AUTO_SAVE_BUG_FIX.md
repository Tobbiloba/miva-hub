# Auto-Save Bug Fix: Prevent Resume After Submission

## 🐛 Bug Description

**Issue**: After completing and submitting a quiz/exam, returning to it showed a "Resume" prompt instead of the results view. Clicking "Resume" would show the results page, but users shouldn't be able to resume completed assessments.

**Root Cause**: When submitting, the `setMode("results")` state change triggered auto-save AFTER the progress was cleared, re-saving the progress with `mode: "results"`.

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Prevent Auto-Save in Results Mode** (Primary Fix)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useQuizProgress.ts` (line 101)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useExamProgress.ts` (line 103)

**Change:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  // ✅ Don't auto-save completed quizzes/exams
  if (data.mode === "results") return;
  
  if (!data || !data.answers || Object.keys(data.answers).length === 0) return;
  // ... rest of save logic
}, [data, debounceMs, performSave]);
```

**Why**: Once a quiz/exam is in results mode, it's completed. No need to save progress anymore.

---

### 2. **Fix Submit Flow** (Race Condition Prevention)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/quiz.tsx` (line 94)
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/exam.tsx` (line 68)

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await forceSave();              // ❌ Saves current state
  await clearQuizProgress(...);   // Clears
  setMode("results");             // ❌ Triggers auto-save again!
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleSubmit = async () => {
  await clearQuizProgress(...);   // ✅ Clear first
  setMode("results");             // Won't trigger auto-save (Layer 1 prevents it)
};
```

**Why**: 
- Removed unnecessary `forceSave()` - answers already auto-saved as user typed
- Clear happens first to prevent race conditions
- Even if auto-save tries to trigger, Layer 1 (results mode check) blocks it

### 3. **Smart Resume Logic** (User Experience Fix)

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/quiz.tsx` (line 52)
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/exam.tsx` (line 56)

**Before:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (savedProgress && !showResumePrompt && mode === "preview") {
    // ❌ Always shows resume prompt, even for completed quizzes
    setShowResumePrompt(true);
  }
}, [savedProgress, showResumePrompt, mode]);
```

**After:**
```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (savedProgress && mode === "preview") {
    if (savedProgress.mode === "results") {
      // ✅ Quiz was completed - restore results view directly
      setAnswers(savedProgress.answers);
      setCurrentQuestion(savedProgress.currentQuestion);
      setMode("results");
    } else if (!showResumePrompt) {
      // ✅ Quiz in progress - show resume option
      setShowResumePrompt(true);
    }
  }
}, [savedProgress, showResumePrompt, mode]);
```

**Why**: 
- Detects if saved progress is from a completed assessment
- If completed (`mode === "results"`): Shows results immediately
- If in progress (`mode === "interactive"`): Shows resume prompt

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario 1: Incomplete Quiz
```
1. User answers 5/10 questions
2. User closes browser
3. User returns → "Resume your previous attempt? (5 questions answered)"
4. User clicks "Resume" → Continues from question 6
```

### Scenario 2: Completed Quiz
```
1. User submits quiz
2. User sees results (e.g., 85%)
3. User closes browser
4. User returns → Results page shown immediately (85%)
5. No resume prompt, no retake option
```

### Scenario 3: Completed Exam with Timer
```
1. User submits exam (time: 5:23 remaining)
2. User sees results
3. User closes browser
4. User returns → Results page shown immediately
5. Timer state no longer relevant (exam completed)
```

## 🛡️ Triple-Layer Protection

The fix uses **3 complementary defenses** to ensure progress is never saved after submission:

1. **Layer 1 (Prevention)**: Auto-save hook checks `data.mode === "results"` and skips saving
2. **Layer 2 (Flow Control)**: Clear happens before mode change in submit handler
3. **Layer 3 (Smart Detection)**: On load, checks saved mode and acts appropriately

**Even if one layer fails, the others catch it.**

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] Modified 4 files with targeted fixes
- [ ] Test incomplete quiz resume
- [ ] Test completed quiz auto-shows results
- [ ] Test incomplete exam resume with timer
- [ ] Test completed exam auto-shows results
- [ ] Test assignment draft saving (should still work normally)
- [ ] Verify no duplicate progress entries in database

## 🚀 Ready to Test

The bug fix is complete. Please test the following:

1. **Complete a quiz** → Close browser → Return → Should show results immediately
2. **Start but don't finish a quiz** → Refresh → Should show resume prompt
3. **Complete an exam** → Close browser → Return → Should show results immediately

If you see a "Resume" prompt after completing a quiz/exam, the fix didn't work. Otherwise, all good! ✅
