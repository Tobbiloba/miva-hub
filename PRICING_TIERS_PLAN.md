‚úì Correct
```

**MAX Feedback:**
```
Question 1: What is a binary search tree?
Your Answer: A tree where left < parent < right

‚úì Correct! 

üìñ Complete Definition:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where:
1. Left subtree contains only nodes with values less than parent
2. Right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than parent  
3. Both left and right subtrees are also BSTs (recursive property)

üí° Why This Matters:
This property enables O(log n) search time in balanced BSTs.
Related concepts: Binary tree, Tree traversal, AVL trees

üéØ Next Steps:
- Can you explain how to insert a node in a BST?
- What happens if the tree becomes unbalanced?

- Celebrates when you get it right

**Example Session:**

```
üë®‚Äçüè´ AI Tutor Mode

Question: Implement a function to reverse a linked list.

Student: "I don't know how to start"

AI: "No problem! Let's think through this step by step.

First question: What do we need to keep track of when 
reversing a linked list? Think about the pointers."

Student: "The next node?"

AI: "Good start! You'll need the next node, yes. But think about 
this: when you reverse an arrow, what else changes?"

Student: "Oh, the previous node too?"

AI: "Excellent! So we need:
1. Current node
2. Previous node  
3. Next node (to not lose the rest of the list)

Now, can you think about what happens in each step? 
What should we do with current.next?"

Student: "Point it to previous?"

AI: "Perfect! üéâ You've got the key insight! 

Here's what happens:
1. Save next node (temp = current.next)
2. Reverse the arrow (current.next = previous)
3. Move forward (previous = current, current = temp)

Now try writing the code yourself. I'll help if you get stuck!"

[Student attempts code...]

AI: "Great attempt! One small issue on line 5. What happens 
when current becomes null? We need to return... what?"

Student: "The previous node!"

AI: "Exactly! Because that's now the new head. You've got it! üéâ"
```

**Why it's better than direct answers:**
- Students actually learn the process
- Develops problem-solving skills
- Better retention
- Confidence building

#### 2. **Offline Mode**

**Technical Approach:**
```typescript
// Service Worker for caching
// frontend/public/sw.js

// Cache strategies:
1. Cache-first: PDFs, videos, static content
2. Network-first: AI requests, user data
3. Stale-while-revalidate: Course materials

// IndexedDB for data storage
- Course materials (text, metadata)
- Downloaded videos (blob storage)
- Flashcards, study guides
- Quiz questions (pre-generated)
- User progress (sync when online)
```

**Features:**
```typescript
// Download manager
interface DownloadManager {
  downloadCourse(courseId: string): Promise<void>
  downloadMaterial(materialId: string): Promise<void>
  getDownloadedSize(): number
  getAvailableSpace(): number
  removeDownload(id: string): Promise<void>
}

// Sync manager
interface SyncManager {
  queueProgressUpdate(data: any): void
  syncWhenOnline(): Promise<void>
  getPendingSyncs(): any[]
}
```

**UI Components:**
```

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Additions Needed

```sql
-- User subscription tracking
CREATE TABLE subscriptions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  plan_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'pro' or 'max'
  status TEXT, -- 'active', 'cancelled', 'expired'
  started_at TIMESTAMP,
  expires_at TIMESTAMP,
  auto_renew BOOLEAN,
  payment_method TEXT
);

-- Usage tracking for limits
CREATE TABLE usage_limits (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  limit_type TEXT, -- 'ai_messages', 'quizzes', 'searches'
  count INT,
  reset_date DATE,
  plan_limit INT
);

-- Feature access control
CREATE TABLE feature_flags (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  feature_name TEXT,
  enabled BOOLEAN,
  granted_until TIMESTAMP -- For temporary upgrades
);

-- Offline downloads
CREATE TABLE offline_content (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_type TEXT,
  content_id TEXT,
  size_mb DECIMAL,
  downloaded_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Middleware for Plan Checking

```typescript
// Middleware to check plan access
async function requirePlan(
  req: Request, 
  res: Response, 
  next: NextFunction,
  requiredPlan: 'pro' | 'max'
) {
  const user = req.user;
  const subscription = await getSubscription(user.id);
  
  if (!subscription || subscription.status !== 'active') {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: 'No active subscription',
      message: 'Please subscribe to use this feature'
    });
  }
  
  if (requiredPlan === 'max' && subscription.plan_type === 'pro') {
    return res.status(403).json({
      error: 'MAX plan required',
      message: 'Upgrade to MAX to access this feature',
      upgrade_url: '/pricing'
    });
  }
  
  next();
}

// Usage limit checking
async function checkLimit(
  userId: string, 
  limitType: string
): Promise<{ allowed: boolean, remaining: number }> {
  const subscription = await getSubscription(userId);
  const usage = await getUsage(userId, limitType);
  
  // MAX users have no limits
  if (subscription.plan_type === 'max') {
    return { allowed: true, remaining: Infinity };
  }
  
  // PRO users check limits
  const limits = {
    ai_messages: 30, // per day
    quizzes: 3,      // per week
    exams: 2,        // per month
    flashcards: 2,   // per week
    searches: 10     // per day
  };
  
  const limit = limits[limitType];
  const remaining = limit - usage.count;
  
  return {
    allowed: remaining > 0,
    remaining: Math.max(0, remaining)
  };
}

// Route protection
app.post('/api/ai/chat', 
  requireAuth,
  async (req, res) => {
    const limit = await checkLimit(req.user.id, 'ai_messages');
    
    if (!limit.allowed) {
      return res.status(429).json({
        error: 'Daily limit reached',
        limit: 'ai_messages',
        remaining: 0,
        resets_at: getNextReset('daily'),
        upgrade_message: 'Upgrade to MAX for unlimited messages',
        upgrade_url: '/pricing'
      });
    }
    
    // Process AI request
    // ...
    
    // Increment usage
    await incrementUsage(req.user.id, 'ai_messages');
    
    res.json({
      ...response,
      usage: {
        remaining: limit.remaining - 1,
        resets_at: getNextReset('daily')
      }
    });
  }
);
```

### Frontend Plan Detection

```typescript
// Hook to check current plan
function usePlan() {
  const { data: session } = useSession();
  
  return {
    isPro: session?.subscription?.plan === 'pro',
    isMax: session?.subscription?.plan === 'max',
    canAccess: (feature: string) => {
      if (session?.subscription?.plan === 'max') return true;
      return PRO_FEATURES.includes(feature);
    }
  };
}

// Usage in components
function AdvancedFeature() {
  const { canAccess } = usePlan();
  
  if (!canAccess('analytics')) {
    return (
      <UpgradePrompt
        feature="Performance Analytics"
        plan="MAX"
        benefits={[
          "See your progress over time",
          "Identify weak areas",
          "Get personalized insights"
        ]}
      />
    );
  }
  
  return <AnalyticsDashboard />;
}

// Feature gating
const PRO_FEATURES = [
  'basic_ai_chat',
  'limited_quizzes',
  'auto_save',
  'pdf_viewer',
  'video_streaming'
];

const MAX_FEATURES = [
  ...PRO_FEATURES,
  'unlimited_ai',
  'analytics',
  'offline_mode',
  'exports',
  'study_groups',
  'advanced_feedback',
  // ... all new features
];
```
