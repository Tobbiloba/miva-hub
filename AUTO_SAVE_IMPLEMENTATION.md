# Auto-Save Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a hybrid auto-save system for Quiz, Exam, and Assignment components that prevents data loss on page refresh by combining localStorage (instant, offline) with backend persistence (cross-device sync).

## Architecture

### Hybrid Approach
```
User types ‚Üí React state update ‚Üí Debounced save (1-2s delay)
  ‚Üì
  ‚îú‚îÄ localStorage (instant, synchronous)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Backend API (async, non-blocking)

On page load:
  Try backend (500ms timeout) ‚Üí Fallback to localStorage
```

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`mcp-server/sql/progress_tables.sql`)

Three tables created:
- `quiz_progress` - Stores quiz answers and current question
- `exam_progress` - Stores exam answers, current question, and timer state
- `assignment_progress` - Stores submission text, files metadata, and links

Features:
- JSONB columns for flexible answer storage
- Unique constraints on (quiz_id, student_id), (exam_id, student_id), (assignment_id, student_id)
- Automatic timestamp tracking
- Auto-cleanup function for entries older than 7 days

### 2. Backend API (`mcp-server/src/api/study_buddy_api.py`)

**9 Endpoints Added:**

Quiz:
- `POST /progress/quiz/save` - Upsert quiz progress
- `GET /progress/quiz/load/{quiz_id}/{student_id}` - Load saved progress
- `DELETE /progress/quiz/clear/{quiz_id}/{student_id}` - Clear after submission

Exam:
- `POST /progress/exam/save` - Upsert exam progress with timer state
- `GET /progress/exam/load/{exam_id}/{student_id}` - Load saved progress
- `DELETE /progress/exam/clear/{exam_id}/{student_id}` - Clear after submission

Assignment:
- `POST /progress/assignment/save` - Upsert assignment draft
- `GET /progress/assignment/load/{assignment_id}/{student_id}` - Load saved draft
- `DELETE /progress/assignment/clear/{assignment_id}/{student_id}` - Clear after submission

### 3. React Hooks

**Created 4 Hooks:**

1. `useAutoSave.ts` - Generic auto-save hook (base implementation)
2. `useQuizProgress.ts` - Quiz-specific with backend integration
3. `useExamProgress.ts` - Exam-specific including timer state
4. `useAssignmentProgress.ts` - Assignment-specific with file metadata

Each hook provides:
- `saveStatus` - Current save state (idle, saving, saved, offline, error)
- `forceSave()` - Manually trigger save
- `useLoadProgress()` - Load saved progress on mount
- `clearProgress()` - Clear after submission

### 4. Component Updates

**Quiz Component (`frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/quiz.tsx`):**
- Auto-save every 1 second after answer changes
- Resume prompt on page load if progress exists
- Save status indicator (Saving.../Saved/Offline)
- Clear progress after submission

**Exam Component (`frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/exam.tsx`):**
- Auto-save every 1 second including timer state
- Resume prompt showing time remaining
- Save status indicator in timer card
- Clear progress after submission or timeout

**Assignment Component (`frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/assignment.tsx`):**
- Auto-save every 2 seconds (longer debounce for text)
- Resume prompt for draft submissions
- Save status indicator as "Draft saved"
- Clear progress after final submission

## Key Features

### 1. Offline-First Design
- localStorage saves immediately (synchronous)
- Backend save happens asynchronously without blocking
- Shows "Offline" status if backend unavailable

### 2. Resume Functionality
All components show a blue alert on page load if unfinished work is detected:
```
Resume your previous attempt? (5 questions answered)
[Start Fresh] [Resume]
```

### 3. Save Status Indicators
Visual feedback for users:
- üîÑ "Saving..." (gray, with spinner)
- ‚úì "Saved" (green)
- ‚òÅÔ∏è "Offline" (yellow, saved locally only)
- ‚úó "Error" (red)

### 4. Smart Debouncing
- Quiz/Exam: 1 second (quick responses)
- Assignment: 2 seconds (longer text editing)

### 5. Automatic Cleanup
- Progress entries auto-delete after 7 days
- Manual clear on submission
- Can be scheduled via pg_cron

## User Authentication Integration

Uses Better Auth with `authClient.useSession()` to:
- Get current student ID
- Scope progress to individual users
- Enable cross-device sync when logged in

## Testing Checklist

Before marking complete, test:

1. **Quiz Auto-Save**
   - [ ] Answer questions, refresh page, verify resume prompt
   - [ ] Test localStorage fallback (disconnect backend)
   - [ ] Verify progress clears after submission
   - [ ] Check save status indicators

2. **Exam Auto-Save**
   - [ ] Answer questions, refresh page, verify timer resumes
   - [ ] Test with time running out
   - [ ] Verify localStorage fallback
   - [ ] Check progress clears after submission/timeout

3. **Assignment Auto-Save**
   - [ ] Type submission text, refresh, verify resume
   - [ ] Add link, refresh, verify resume
   - [ ] Test save status "Draft saved"
   - [ ] Verify progress clears after final submission

4. **Cross-Device Sync**
   - [ ] Start quiz on device A
   - [ ] Open same quiz on device B (same student)
   - [ ] Verify progress synced

5. **Offline Mode**
   - [ ] Disconnect backend
   - [ ] Verify localStorage saves work
   - [ ] Verify "Offline" status shows
   - [ ] Reconnect and verify sync

## Database Migration

**To apply the schema:**
```bash
psql -U your_user -d your_database -f mcp-server/sql/progress_tables.sql
```

Or run via your migration tool.

## File Manifest

**Database:**
- `mcp-server/sql/progress_tables.sql` (new)

**Backend:**
- `mcp-server/src/api/study_buddy_api.py` (modified, added 9 endpoints)

**Frontend Hooks:**
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAutoSave.ts` (existing, base)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useQuizProgress.ts` (new)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useExamProgress.ts` (new)
- `frontend/src/hooks/useAssignmentProgress.ts` (new)

**Frontend Components:**
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/quiz.tsx` (modified)
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/exam.tsx` (modified)
- `frontend/src/components/tool-invocation/assignment.tsx` (modified)

## Next Steps

1. Apply database migration
2. Test end-to-end functionality
3. Consider adding progress indicators to sidebar/dashboard
4. Monitor backend performance under load
5. Set up pg_cron for automatic cleanup

## Notes

- Backend URL hardcoded as `http://localhost:8083` - update for production
- File uploads for assignments not fully implemented (stores metadata only)
- Consider adding compression for large submission texts
- May want to add progress percentage to dashboard
