Introduction
Course Description 

Explore advanced object-oriented programming concepts, including polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. Learn effective program organisation with packages and namespaces and utilise APIs for iterators, lists, stacks, and queues. Delve into searching, sorting, and recursive algorithms. Master event-driven programming, covering event-handling methods, propagation, and exception handling. Apply these skills to graphic user interface (GUI) programming for real-world applications.

Course Content 

Review and coverage of advanced object-oriented programming: polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. Class hierarchies and programme organisation using packages and namespaces. Use of API: use of iterators and enumerators, List, stacks, and queues from API; Searching; sorting; Recursive algorithms; Event-driven programming: event-handling methods; event propagation; exception handling. Applications in Graphical User Interface (GUI) programming.

Course Objectives

At the end of this course, students should be able to: 

Develop solutions for a range of problems using object-oriented programming in C++; use modules, packages, and namespaces for programme organisation
Use API when writing applications
Apply the divide and conquer strategy to searching for and sorting problems using iterative and/or recursive solutions, and explain the concept of exceptions in programming and how to handle exceptions in programmes.
Write simple multi-threaded applications, and design and implement simple GUI applications.

Assessments open: Saturday, 25 October 2025, 12:00 AM
Assessments close: Friday, 7 November 2025, 11:59 PM
Instructions:

Read the rubrics thoroughly to understand both the criteria for answering the question and grading your peers.

You will evaluate the work of 2-3 assigned peers after you have submitted your work.
Your score/grade will be visible after you have completed grading your assigned peers.
Note the following:

Adhere to principles of academic integrity throughout the assessment and grading process.
Provide constructive feedback, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
Respect deadlines for submission and grading.
Maintain open communication and collaboration among peers.
Show professionalism and respect in all interactions with peers.
 

Question:
Discuss the concept of polymorphism in C++ with a focus on both compile-time and runtime polymorphism. How does each type of polymorphism work, and what are their respective advantages and disadvantages? In your discussion, illustrate your points with relevant code examples to demonstrate the use of function overloading, operator overloading (compile-time polymorphism), and virtual functions (runtime polymorphism). Additionally, explain how polymorphism contributes to code reusability and maintainability in large-scale software development projects.
